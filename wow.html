    <p>World of Warcraft has been an on-and-off passion of mine dating right back to when it first released.
        I have never played for the full expansion, but often times come back for the first couple patches of an
        expansion.
        I have "quit" more than once and when the Warlords of Draenor expansion came out I vowed I wouldn't get it...
        After I caved and bought the expansion I've just accepted the fact that I'll play each new one when it comes
        out.
    </p>
    <p>This is the first expansion that I've seriously raided though. Somehow I have more friends playing
        than any other. The first raid, Uldir, was reasonably fun and i've come back for the new raid that dropped
        on January 22nd.
